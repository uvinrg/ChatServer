# ChatServer
Telnet based C++ Chat Server
Copyright Vlad Ionut Ursachi 2016

Features:
- server is multi-platform, can be compiled and run on Windows, Linux and MacOS
- server supports all the commands from the specification plus /whisper
- when connected to the server with telnet as a client, the server will inform the user all of its commands.
- joining a non-existent room will create it and place the user inside it.
- in each ChatServer/platform/* folder a config.h file is provided where the developer can change the default port number, the maximum number of concurrent clients and the maximum line size of a chat message.
- the server automatically detects when users login or drop out and performs the required actions, removing them from chat rooms and informing the other users.
